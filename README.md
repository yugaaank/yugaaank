# 👋 Hi, I'm Yug

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student who enjoys building things that actually work, breaking them, and then fixing them properly.  
Currently exploring **AI/ML**, **software engineering fundamentals**, and **clean system-level thinking**.

I like projects that feel real, not tutorial leftovers.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- C++ and backend fundamentals (doing it right, not rushing)
- AI/ML concepts with practical applications
- Robotics & prosthetic-related projects
- Web projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NextJS
- Linux-based workflows (because clicking is overrated)
